// Implements Sleeping Barber Problem with option to set all parameters
// and with deterministic waiting times.
//
// * a barber manage a shop with a waiting room
// * a waiting room has got some seats
// * some clients enter the shop, try to find a free seat
// * free seat: ok, wait for barber or wake him if he is sleeping
// * no seat: go out... (and retry later if you want)
// * if the barber has no clients, he decide to sleep
// * if client enter and see that the barber is sleeping, wake him
